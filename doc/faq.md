### Which tractograms can I use with COMMIT?

Any tractogram can be fed to the COMMIT framework, as long as each tract is represented as a polyline, i.e. sequence of consecutive segments. At the moment, however, COMMIT only reads tractograms in the [TrackVis](http://www.trackvis.org/docs/?subsect=fileformat) file format, but additional format will be accepted in the future. Meanwhile, several converters between file formats are available (e.g. [http://dipy.org](DIPY) python library); please apologize for the inconvenience.
